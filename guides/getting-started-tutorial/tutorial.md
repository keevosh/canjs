*Better Apps, Faster*

CanJS is a lightweight, modern JavaScript <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_View_ViewModel" target="_blank">MVVM</a>
framework that’s fast and easy to use, while remaining robust and extensible
enough to power some of the most trafficked websites in the world. This guide 
will walk you through an analysis of a small e-commerce app built with CanJS called Place My Order. 
In each relevant section, we'll give you some code to play with
so you can have hands on experience working with CanJS, as you learn.

## The Basics
Every CanJS application contains:

- [Observables](#observables),
- [Models](#models),
- [Views](#views),
- [Components](#components),
- [Application State](#appstate), and
- [Routing](#routing)

<a name="observables"></a>
### Observables
Observable objects provide a way for you make changes to data and listen to
those changes. Observables such as `can.List` and `can.Map` provide the
foundation for updating model objects, views, and even routes in your app.

<a name="models"></a>
### Models
Models manage the data of an application. A model notifies the elements
associated with it when its state has changed. In CanJS this is the [can.Model](../docs/can.Model.html)
object. `can.Model` makes it almost effortless to handle all of your CRUD
(Create, Read, Update, and Delete) operations.

<a name="views"></a>
### Views 
Views request information from the model and use the data it provides to
generate visual output that’s meaningful to a user—in our case HTML. In
CanJS, views are created using:

1. View Templates,
2. The [can.view](../docs/can.view.html) object

The view template can be plain HTML or it can utilize a template library
to provide it with more functionality. Most of the time, your views will work
with a template library. CanJS supports several JS template libraries,
including:

- Stache
- Mustache

While you can use any of the above template types, the preferred type
is [Stache](../docs/can.stache.html). It provides the most clarity to your code and is the easiest
of the two options to use. At this time, Stache is supplied as a supporting
library, which means you must explicitly add it to your application. We’ll see
how to do that when we set up our application in the next chapter. In future
releases of CanJS, Stache will be available as a part of the core CanJS lib.

Template libraries require a rendering engine and CanJS provides that for
you with the `can.view` object. `can.view` contains
utilities “for the loading, processing, rendering, and live-updating of
templates”. In addition, `can.view` is used to bind views to observable
objects.

<a name="components"></a>
### Components
A [can.Component](../docs/can.Component.html) is like a mini web application.
It contains the JavaScript, CSS, and HTML necessary to create a fully functional  
item. This makes `can.Component`’s portable, reusable, and
encapsulated. `can.Component`’s are easy to test and easy to use. Building an
application with them is kind of like building with Legos&trade;. As we say
at Bitovi, “The secret to building large applications is to never build large
applications.” Rather, you build the components you need and link them
together using the Application State and Routing to compose your application.

<a name="appstate"></a>
### Application State
One of the things that sets CanJS apart from other frameworks is its use
of an Application State object. An Application State object, or AppState object for short,
is an observable object that, as its name implies, contains the state of 
your application. Where other application frameworks model their applications 
with routes, controllers, etc., CanJS takes a more unified, semantic approach. 
It encapsulates the state of your application. This is a 
very powerful approach to writing applications that freeis developers from 
many of the constraints of a DOM-centric paradigm, allowing them to think more directly 
about the application itself.

<a name="routing"></a>
### Routing
For many JavaScript MV* frameworks, routing divides an application into
logical views and binds those view to Controllers. *This is not how things work in
CanJS*. Routing in CanJS has nothing to do with binding views to Controllers.
Rather, it has to do with AppState. In brief,
CanJS maintains a reciprocal relationship between an application’s route
and its state. In other words, if you change the state of an application,
your route will change. If you change your route, your application’s state
will change.

This is a very powerful programming paradigm. For example, you can recreate
a specific state in your application from any point, just by accessing a
specific route.

If this doesn't make sense right now, don't worry. As we develop our
application together, you’ll see, more and more, how this works, and just 
how powerful this aspect of CanJS can be.
